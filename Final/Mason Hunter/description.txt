Mason Hunter CIS 120 final project description

Scoring
    - numbered cards = number, face cards = 10, ace = 1 or 10
    
Deal
    -2 cards to a player, then rotate to next player
        The traditional method of giving each player two cards, then giving the next
        player two cards, etc. until everyone has two cards.

Dealer
    The dealer includes the card deck, which is a compilation of 52 different cards
    of tuple form: (Actual Card (i.e Ace of Spades), 21 hand value).  The dealer
    will be the facilitator and all card related business and winner determining
    will run through him.
Players
    - 1 hand per player
    - Before each hand player wagers an amount (everybody starts with 5$)
        Everybody will start the round game with 5 $, then wagers to either gain
        or lose it.  If a player gets down to zero then they are kicked out.
    - 4 players, one is user
        The players will be static characters which can be eliminated, but come
        back to life every time a new game is started.  They are different in styles,
        gambling tendencies, and (hopefully) they will have quips to say in 
        various situations.
Cards
    -52 cards
    -standard values, ace can be either 1 or 11 (but must be declared when you
     receive it, you can't change your mind later)
    -There won't be a shuffle function, but instead it will be a list of cards (see
      above) with a random integer generator from between 0 and len(deck) which will
      remove a card from the deck and give it to a player.
    
Save game
    -save a profile (but you can't quit mid-hand) with total amount won.  Since in
     real life you can't leave the table in the middle of a hand.  Each player will
     have a profile that gets saved with their total winnings.
    
High Score
    - most won to date for any profile.

    - Determine winner

Win situations:
    - Closest to 21 without going over wins
    - Tie = split the pot.  Since there will be a measure of gambling, I feel that
                            splitting the pot will be the most appropriate action
                            to take in the event of a tie.
