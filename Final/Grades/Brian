Took me a minute to realize how to use the menu.  

I like the layout of the screen.  One criticism: It might be better to be consistent.  If you call into the flop the table changes some which could be avoided.

Pokerface.py:
        import os.path is redundant with import os
        
        Calling help.url doesn't work on macs.  Ther eis a workaround, but it is more complex.
        I'll accept this as you built on a PC.  Can't expect you to consider all possible 
        mishaps from using different OSes.

player.py:
        Slightly better for lines 9-12 would be to make line 6 be:
        def __init__(self, name, cash = 100): 
        that provides the default. Then you only need line 12, not the if-else statement.
        
        You treat it as a dict in the rest of the program, I'll assume that is what it is.
        Why are you initiating self.hand on line 17 as a dictionary when you state it 
        is a list in receivecards()?

        Your calchand() function could really use some more commenting.

card.py:
        I like the use of colors, though it doesn't affect your game.  
        It is properly part of a card.

        You thought through the card needs, more than just the val and num.
        Storing extra information to make it easier to calculate the values you need is great.

deck.py:
        Nice, calling a function from init using self.createdeck()

table.py:
        Good detail on the burnnturn() incidentally the elif could be an else.

Generic:
        More Commenting!
