        You use the replace sequence 4 times.  That should have been a function.
        
        also, that entire sequence could have been replaced with one line:      
        board = ''.join(x for x in board if x.isdigit())

memory.py:
        using while user_reply == 'x' is a weird way of doing what you want.  I think an
        if elif else statement would have been clearer.
