Hey Dan!
I bet you're wondering why I left out so many things you asked for in this final.  Or maybe you're reading this first, either way, I feel it's worth explaining.  I didn't just leave out stuff to be lazy, but I ran out of time to impliment them and I felt it was more important just to make sure I had a working version of the game to send to you.

Additionally, I truly didn't have myself in mind for the extension email that I sent.  I didn't realize the trouble that the save system was going to give me.

In short, I'm not looking for sympathy, just want you to know I wasn't just being lazy.  Somehow that makes me feel better amongst this crazy amount of frustration.

Also, I couldn't split up the classes without breaking absolutely everything it seemed.  I'll talk to you on Monday about that.

Brian
