Help and Instructions for the Bag of Rocks. 

Hello! Welcome to the Help and Instructions of Going to Boston. 
Luckily for you, even though you do not understand, I am here to help.

If you were in the main menu and don't know what to do, press 1.
The way to press 1, is to look where your hands are now (hopefully)
on the keyboard. Then, find the number 1. If you do not know what that looks 
like, I'm sorry but there is no hope for you. 
Press the key (GENTLYYYYYYYYYYYYY!) and await further instructions. 

If you are in the middle of the game and are lost, press 2.
The way to press 2, is to look where your hands are now (hopefully)
on the keyboard. Then, find the number 2. If you do not know what that looks
like, I'm sorry but there is no hope for you.
Press the key (GENTLYYYYYYYYYYYYY!) and await further instructions.
