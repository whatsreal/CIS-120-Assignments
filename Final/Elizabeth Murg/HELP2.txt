GOOD JOB! SEE NOT SO BAD!!!! :) 
Now that you are here, let me explain to you what to do in the
Main Menu section. 

You will be given a list of 5 options next to the numbers 1 - 5.
To choose an option, click the keyboard button associated with the number
next to that specific option. 

To return to the main menu just type in the word RETURN (like that in all Caps Lock.) To exit type in NO.
