GOOD JOB! SEE NOT SO BAD!!!! :)
Now that you are here, let me explain to you what to do in the 
game. Basically, first you will type your name in. :) 

Then, you will choose how many players you would like to verse or 
play against. Do not include yourself in the number of players. You
are automatically a player!

Next, you will choose the amount of rounds you wish to play. This means that 
you can start out with as many dice as you choose and they will progressively lessen 
with each round. 

To play just type in yes when asked if you want to roll. Then sit back, relax, and
have as much fun as you possibly can...I mean this is only a text-based...dice...game
which....yeah, doesn't really cut it in my idea of fun! :)
