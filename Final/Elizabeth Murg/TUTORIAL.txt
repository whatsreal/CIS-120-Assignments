RULES AND REGULATIONS! :)

Age: 5+ (SO IF YOU'RE NOT AT LEAST 5 YEARS OLD, GO AWAY.)

Skills: Button-Clicking and at least as much knowledge as a bag of rocks.

Equipment: Fingers and...eyes...

How to play: Roll the dice and keep the highest by clicking the number you wish to keep. 
	Roll the remaining dice and again set aside the highest.			 
	Roll the last die. Then, the computer will add your scores, and MAY THE ODDS BE EVER IN YOUR FAVOR ;)

To Win: I feel like this is blatantly obvious but to win, you obviously need the highest score. 

The End.
