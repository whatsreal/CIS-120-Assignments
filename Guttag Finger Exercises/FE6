#Finger Exercise 6
#Chapter 3 Section 3

#Consider the following code:

x = 5
epsilon = 0.01
numGuesses = 0
low - 0.0
high = max(1.0, x)
ans = (high + low)/2.0

while abs(ans**2 - x) >= epsilon:
	print 'low=', low, 'high=', high, 'ans=', ans
	numGuesses += 1
	if ans**2 < x:
	    low = ans
	else:
	    high = ans
	ans = (high + low)/2.0
	
print numGuesses =', numGuesses
print ans, "is close to the square root of", x

#Explain what happens when you set x = -25 in the first line.

#Don't bother with the FE below:
""" What would have to be changed to make the code above work for finding an approximation
of the cube root of both negative and positive numbers?..."""
