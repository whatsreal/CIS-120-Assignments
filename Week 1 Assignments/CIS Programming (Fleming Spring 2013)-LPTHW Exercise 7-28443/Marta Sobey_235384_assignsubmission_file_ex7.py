#This line prints the string "Mary had a little lamb."
print "Mary had a little lamb."
#This line prints the string "Its fleece was white as %s." where %s refers to the string 'snow'
print "Its fleece was white as %s." % 'snow'
#This line prints the string "And everywhere that Mary went."
print "And everywhere that Mary went."
#This line printed the symbol "." 10 times in a row.
print "." * 10 # what'd that do"
#putting "." * 10 was like saying write the "." symbol ten times in a row. Therefore, that command made the following: ".........."

#The variable end1 was assigned the letter "C"
end1 = "C"
#The variable end2 was assigned the letter "h"
end2 = "h"
#The variable end3 was assigned the letter "e"
end3 = "e"
#The variable end4 was assigned the letter "e"
end4 = "e"
#The variable end5 was assigned the letter "s"
end5 = "s"
#The variable end6 was assigned the letter "e"
end6 = "e"
#The variable end7 was assigned the letter "B"
end7 = "B"
#The variable end8 was assigned the letter "u"
end8 = "u"
#The variable end9 was assigned the letter "r"
end9 = "r"
#The variable end10 was assigned the letter "g"
end10 = "g"
#The variable end11 was assigned the letter "e"
end11 = "e"
#The variable end12 was assigned the letter "r"
end12 = "r"

# watch that comma at the end. try removing it to see what happens
#This line prints the contents of the variable 'end1' followed by 'end2' followed by 'end3' followed by 'end4' followed by 'end5' followed by 'end6'
print end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6,
#Because of the comma at the end of line 41 this line continues on after the contents of the variable 'end6' with the content of the variable 'end7' followed by 'end8' followed by 'end9' followed by 'end10' followed by 'end11' followed by 'end12'
print end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12
#removing the comma at the end makes the word 'cheese' go on one line while the word 'burger' is printed directly below it on a different line
