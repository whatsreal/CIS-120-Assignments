Mostly pretty good.

Couple of things:

1) You should be checking for dups at add time. Makes more sense to simply not allow the addition of duplicates rather than require the end user to run it later.
2) Inside the dupcheck() you are using unnecessary number of for loops.  Both of the for i in contactlist loops could have been done in the same loop saving you O(n) of processing time.
3)The if else statement at the end could be done as if/elif/else instead of if/else(if/else)

Otherwise nice!
