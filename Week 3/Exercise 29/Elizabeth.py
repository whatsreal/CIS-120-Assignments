#Study Drill 1. "IF" will tell the program to check the numbers and see whether they meet the specified requirements
#Study Drill 2. Probably so the program will know the print statement is linked to the if statement
#Study Drill 3. Nothing prints.
#Study Drill 5. If you change the initial variable for people, cats, and dogs, you need to change it throughout to get the thing to work.
